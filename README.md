# ML-Algorithm-to-minimize-cost-of-manufacturing-process

This repository contains implementations of various optimization and simulation projects aimed at solving real-world problems in manufacturing and inventory management, along with a classification task for widget quality assessment.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for Manufacturing Cost Minimization
- **Objective**: Minimize the total manufacturing cost by optimizing the number of workers and machines.
- **Key Features**:
  - Calculates labor and machine costs with penalties for underproduction.
  - Utilizes PSO to find optimal resource combinations.
  - Visualizes cost landscape with a 3D surface plot.

### 2. Monte Carlo Simulation for Inventory Management
- **Objective**: Optimize inventory levels to reduce customer wait times and shelf times.
- **Key Features**:
  - Simulates customer orders and inventory availability over a year.
  - Analyzes average wait and shelf times.
  - Visualizes results with histograms and summary statistics using Pandas.

### 3. Widget Classification Using Random Forest
- **Objective**: Classify widgets as defective or non-defective based on their features.
- **Key Features**:
  - Generates synthetic data for widget characteristics.
  - Trains a Random Forest classifier and evaluates its performance.
  - Visualizes feature importance to identify key predictors.
